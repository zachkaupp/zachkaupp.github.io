	<h2>About my programming hobby</h2>
	<p>I started programming on Khan Academy in the beginning of 8th grade. I was learning the Intro to 
	Javascript visualizations.  After that I took the HTML and CSS course on Khan Academy.  Once I had 
	completed those and I felt like my programming skills were advanced enough, I tried some of the Computer Science
	courses.  I tried the first one and didn't like it so I went to the Information theory one.  I got a little ways into that 
	before I decided to spread out my leanrning. I took a short cousrse called Internet 101, and then got to work
	on another Javascript course.  It was different from the Khan academy one because it focuses on the command line 
	instead of the canvas.  I also started a course on Java because of all the things you can do with it and am planning on learning Kotlin
	after I finish that.  Right now I am also in a swift course by apple that I can access through apple books.  I am especially happy
	about his one because it is a series of courses. Including a AP Computer Science course.
