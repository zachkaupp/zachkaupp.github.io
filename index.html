		Hi welcome to my website. You are now on the home page.  I built this website originally for a computer science project in 8th grade.  I figured out how to host it for free on GitHub and decided to do that. Now I call it "My Website" and put whatever I want on it.  Also this is my first website other than a quick "Hello World" I did to try out Adobe Brackets. Now I use it to show friends, and to practice HTML, CSS, and possibly Javascript in the near future. P.S. After clicking around on the navigation bar, click on my profile picture to get back to the main page.
