		Hello, my name is Zach Kaupp. I am interested in programming and as of now, I am familiar with HMTL, CSS, Swift, and some Javascript. I created this website for fun and to practice my HTML and CSS. If I know you, you should know that this website is full of random stuff that I put up when I am bored. Nothing on this website should harm your computer, but if it does start heating up, you should close out of the website. This is kind of my playground... By the way sometimes I don't update this thing for a while so if you see something that does not make sense it is probably since I haven't changed it in a while. (btw the profile picture is a home button) I try and make it so you can access this on your phone, but without javascript it gets kinda hard. Also, if you wanna be a homie you can hook me up with your netflix family plan.
